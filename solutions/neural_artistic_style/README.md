# Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style

This example shows the implementation of of the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). They use deep learning to extract the style of a picture, in this case Vincent van Gogh's Starry Night, and transfer it to a new image.
